Assume a cache with 2K 2-word blocks and 16 bit addresses

Find the total number of sets and the total number of tag bits for a 

direct mapped cache 
	Sets = Blocks, total sets = 2K
	log(2k)=11 bits for index
	8 bytes/block -> offset = 3 -> 16 - 3 - 11 = 2 bits for tag -> 13 bits for tag and index.
	2 tag bits/location * 2k locations = 4Kbits for total tag bits

two-way set associative cache
	Sets = blocks/2, total sets = 1K
	log(1k)=10 bits for index
	8 bytes/block -> offset = 3 -> 16 - 3 - 10 = 3 bits for tag -> 13 bits for tag and index.
	3 tag bits/location * 2 locations/set * 1k sets  = 6Kbits for total tag bits

four-way set associative cache
	Sets = blocks/4, total sets = 512
	log(512)=9 bits for index
	8 bytes/block -> offset = 3 -> 16 - 3 - 9 = 4 bits for tag -> 13 bits for tag and index.
	4 tag bits/location * 4 locations/set * 512 sets = 8Kbits for total tag bits
	
fully associative cache
	1 Set of 2k Blocks
	index = 0 bits -> 13 bits for the tag.
	13 tag bits/location * 2k locations/set * 1 set = 26Kbits for total tag bits
