The Operating System (OS) orchestrates the activity of all of the program’s scheduled tasks.  For a simple OS, a periodic timer interrupt can call an OS function (often called a timer “Tick”) that calls the appropriate functions in the appropriate sequence at the appropriate “task” time intervals.

Use this directory to store the OS related files.
